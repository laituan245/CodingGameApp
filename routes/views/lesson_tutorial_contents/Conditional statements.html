  Python uses boolean variables to evaluate conditions. The boolean values True and False are returned when an expression is compared or evaluated. For example:
  <pre><code class="python">x = 2
print x == 2 # prints out True
print x == 3 # prints out False
print x < 3  # prints out True</code></pre>
Notice that variable assignment is done using a single equals operator "=", whereas comparison between two variables is done using the double equals operator "==". The "not equals" operator is marked as "!=".

  <h3>Boolean operators</h3>
  The "and" and "or" boolean operators allow building complex boolean expressions, for example:
  <pre><code class="python">name = "John"
age = 23
if name == "John" and age == 23:
    print "Your name is John, and you are also 23 years old."

if name == "John" or name == "Rick":
    print "Your name is either John or Rick."</code></pre>
  </br>

  <h3>The "in" operator</h3>
  The "in" operator could be used to check if a specified object exists within an iterable object container, such as a list:
  <pre><code class="python">if name in ["John", "Rick"]:
    print "Your name is either John or Rick."
</code></pre>
Python uses indentation to define code blocks, instead of brackets. The standard Python indentation is 4 spaces, although tabs and any other space size will work, as long as it is consistent. Notice that code blocks do not need any termination.
</br>
Here is an example for using Python's "if" statement using code blocks:
  <pre><code class="python">if <statement is true>:
    <do something>
    ....
    ....
elif <another statement is true>: # else if
    <do something else>
    ....
    ....
else:
    <do another thing>
    ....
    ....</code></pre>

    For example:
    <pre><code class="python">x = 2
if x == 2:
    print "x equals two!"
else:
    print "x does not equal to two."
</code></pre>
A statement is evaulated as true if one of the following is correct: 1. The "True" boolean variable is given, or calculated using an expression, such as an arithmetic comparison. 2. An object which is not considered "empty" is passed.
</br>
Here are some examples for objects which are considered as empty: 1. An empty string: "" 2. An empty list: [] 3. The number zero: 0 4. The false boolean variable: False
  </br>

  <h3>The 'is' operator</h3>
Unlike the double equals operator "==", the "is" operator does not match the values of the variables, but the instances themselves. For example:
<pre><code class="python">x = [1,2,3]
y = [1,2,3]
print x == y # Prints out True
print x is y # Prints out False</code></pre>
</br>


<h3>The 'not' operator</h3>
Using "not" before a boolean expression inverts it:
<pre><code class="python">print not False # Prints out True
print (not False) == (False) # Prints out False</code></pre>
</br>
